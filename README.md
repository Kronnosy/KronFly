# ðŸš€ KronFly

**KronFly** is a powerful plugin for **PocketMine-MP** servers, providing flexible control over players' fly modes. It ensures that admins can efficiently manage flying abilities while preserving gameplay balance.

## âœ¨ Features

- **Fly Mode Control**  
  Players can enable or disable their own fly mode, with an automatic check to prevent disabling it while airborne. Administrators, however, can disable other players' fly mode without this restriction.

- **ActionBar Messages**  
  To avoid chat clutter, all notifications and messages are displayed via ActionBar, ensuring a clean and uninterrupted gaming experience.

- **Permission System**  
  The plugin uses a two-permission system:
  - `kronfly.command.fly.use` â€“ Allows players to control their own fly mode.
  - `kronfly.command.fly.others` â€“ Allows administrators to manage other players' fly mode.

- **Configurable World Restrictions**  
  Limit the use of fly mode in specific worlds by adding them to the config file, giving you control over where flying is allowed.

- **Customizable Messages**  
  Easily modify the content of messages sent by the plugin through the config file, tailoring them to your serverâ€™s tone and style.
